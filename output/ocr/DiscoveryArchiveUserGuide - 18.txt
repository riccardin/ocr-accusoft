Restore Emails
You can use the Restore feature in Discovery Archive to send an exact copy of the email back to any user's mailbox. The restoration process only

can see the original timestamp of the email by opening it in your Outlook or Notes Inbox.
To restore an email
1. Right-click on the email you want to restore and select Restore.

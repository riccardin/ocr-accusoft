Tag Emails
During the review process, reviewers can tag emails for review at a later date or to share certain types of emails with another reviewer.
For example, if a search returns many emails that contain inappropriate words, the reviewer may need to review the results more closely to
determine if the context in which the words were used are appropriate according to company policies. The reviewer can tag questionable emails
and use the tag to retrieve these emails at a later time.

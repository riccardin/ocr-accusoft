 You can use the features available from the Managed Accounts node to conduct initial, probative, or ad hoc investigations in an archive,
outside of the legal discovery workflow. Once you are ready to conduct searches and reviews on a specific subject, you should create a Matter to
track these searches.
 Expand the Saved Searches node and select New Search to perform a search across all archives assigned to you.

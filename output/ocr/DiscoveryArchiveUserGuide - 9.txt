Recommended Practices for Discovery Archive Search
Discovery Archive's robust search functionality allows users to quickly and easily search for specific emails, groups of emails, domains, accounts,
saved searches, or reports. Basic search functionality is available regardless of the tab or menu tree you are working under.
 Users assigned the Accounts role can perform searches only within their own archives, while Reviewers and Administrators have a wider
variety of search options.
Discovery Archive includes Basic Search or Advanced Search. Depending on your administrative privileges and the area of Discovery Archive
you are searching, you can use these features to search:
0 A single archive (Accounts in Managed Accounts node)
• All archives (New Search in Managed Accounts node)
0 The archives for a subset of users (E-Discovery tab)

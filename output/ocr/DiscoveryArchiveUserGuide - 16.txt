About Matter Management
Collaborative Discovery (accessed from the E-Discovery tab) includes all the Matter Management features in Discovery Archive that allow multiple
reviewers to interact and collaborate on litigation Matters during the e-discovery process. Once a Discovery Archive administrator creates a new
Matter, the administrator or designated reviewers can use the Basic and Advanced Search features to find emails relevant to the Matter. These
searches can then be saved and assigned to various reviewers to distribute the workload and expedite the e-discovery process. During the review
process, reviewers can place emails on legal hold, apply review statuses or labels, tag emails, and add notes to emails that can be viewed by
other reviewers working on the Matter. Additionally, Collaborative Discovery includes various reporting features that allow reviewers to view audit
trails for individual emails or the history of an entire Matter.
Please refer to the Collaborative Discovery Guide for more information about using these new features of Discovery Archive.
 The Discovery Archive user interface has been updated. You can now access all the Matter Management features from the new E-Discovery
tab.

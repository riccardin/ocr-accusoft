"Monitor All Accounts" when being assigned the Administrator role. See Assign the Administrator Role for more information.
O It is possible to restrict Administrator access. Please refer to the Archive Administration User Guide for more information.

 Reviewers can use the Administration tab to change their own password and personal time zone.
Reviewers typically monitor other employees' emails for material that does not follow company communication policies. An Administrator or HR
representative typically reviews the email of Reviewers, so that no employees are exempt from following company communication policies.
Administrators assign individuals the role of Reviewer in the Administration Console, located outside the Discovery Archive interface. See Assign
the Reviewer Role for more information.
 Organizations should take special care in selecting the appropriate employees for the Reviewer role, since Reviewers can see other
employees' emails. It is also important to ensure that Reviewers do not share their user name and password with anyone.

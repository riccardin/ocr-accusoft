Discovery Archive User Guide
Discovery Archive is a fully managed web-based service that allows your company to proactively respond to litigation requests and ensure
adherence to company communication policies. Designated individuals in your company can use Discovery Archive to search through current and
legacy emails, permanently store material for litigation purposes, and export materials for review by outside parties.
The following User Guide provides additional information about Discovery Archive and instructions for using its key features. You can also
download the Discovery Archive User Guide in PDF format.
 Collaborative Discovery (accessed from the E-Discovery tab) includes all the Matter Management features in Discovery Archive that allow
multiple reviewers to interact and collaborate on litigation Matters during the e-discovery process. Please refer to the Collaborative Discovery
Guide for more information about using these new features of Discovery Archive.
